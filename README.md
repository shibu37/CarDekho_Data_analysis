# CarDekho_Data_analysis
Introduction:

Our project focuses on leveraging data analysis techniques to extract valuable insights from the Car Dekho dataset, sourced from Kaggle. As a renowned platform for buying and selling new and used cars, Car Dekho's dataset presents a rich source of information encompassing various aspects of the automotive industry. Our objective was to harness this data to gain deeper understanding and provide actionable insights for stakeholders in the automotive sector.

Data Acquisition and Cleaning:

The initial phase of our project involved acquiring the Car Dekho dataset from Kaggle, ensuring data integrity and completeness. We meticulously cleaned the dataset, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure its suitability for analysis. By employing data cleaning techniques such as imputation, removal of duplicates, and normalization, we ensured that the dataset was primed for further analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

With a clean and structured dataset at our disposal, we delved into exploratory data analysis to uncover meaningful patterns and trends. Leveraging statistical methods and visualization techniques, we examined various aspects of the automotive industry, including car features, pricing dynamics, brand preferences, and market trends. Through insightful visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots, we provided stakeholders with a comprehensive overview of the dataset, enabling them to make informed decisions.
